 file 0: a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout/ no need to manage file permissions or file doesn't exist exceptions
 
 file 1: a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written/   no need to manage file permission exceptions/non existent file/ function should create the file if doesn’t exist & overwrite the content of the file if it already exists
                                                                                                            
 file 2: a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added / no need to manage file permissions or file doesn't exist exceptions
                                                                                                                      
 file 3: a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string): /no need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized.         
 
 file 4: a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string:/ no need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object.
 
 file 5:  a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation: / no manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized nor file permission exceptions
 
 file 6: a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”: / no need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object nor file exceptions/permissions
 
 file 7:  a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file: / The list must be saved as a JSON representation in a file named add_item.json/ If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created / You don’t need to manage file permissions / exceptions.
 
 file 8:  a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object
 
 file 9: a class Student that defines a student
 
 file 10: a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)
 
 file 11: a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py)
 
 file 12: a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n
