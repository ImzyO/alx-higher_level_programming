                                                      NB: In all files, Not allowed to import any modules
                                   
File 0: A function that prints all integers of a list
        used str.format() / assume that the list only contains integers / one integer per line

File 1: A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C
        not allowed to use try/except

File 2:  A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C)
         not allowed to use try/except

File 3: A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order
        assume that the list only contains integers / used str.format()

File 4: A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)
        not allowed to use try/except

File 5: A function that removes all characters c and C from a string
        not allowed to use str.replace()
        
File 6: A function that prints a matrix of integers
        use str.format() / assume that the list only contains integers
        
File 7: A function that adds 2 tuples
        Returns a tuple with 2 integers: / The first element should be the addition of the first element of each argument / The second element should be the addition of the second element of each argument
        
File 8: A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character

File 9: A function that finds the biggest integer of a list
        not allowed to use the builtin max() / assume that the list only contains integers

File 11: A function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list
           not allowed to use pop()
           
File 12: Completes source code in order to switch value of a and b
