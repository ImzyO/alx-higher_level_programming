In this project, you will review everything about Python:

* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Getter/Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/Write file


LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General;
1. What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
2. How to serialize and deserialize a Class
3. How to write and read a JSON file
4. What is *args and how to use it
5. What is **kwargs and how to use it
6. How to handle named arguments in a function



REQUIREMENTS:

A. Python Scripts
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
5. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
6. Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
7. All your files must be executable
8. The length of your files will be tested using wc
9. All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
10. All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
11. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
12. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)


B. Python Unit Tests
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files should end with a new line
3. All your test files should be inside a folder tests
4. You have to use the unittest module
5. All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
6. All your test files and folders should start with test_
7. Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
8. All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
9. You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
10. We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case
