                                                NB: In all files, Not allowed to import any module
                                                
 File 0: A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix
         Initial matrix should not be modified  
         
 File 1: A function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list
         my_list is the initial list / search is the element to replace in the list / replace is the new element
         
 File 2: A function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer)
         
 File 3: A function that returns a set of common elements in two sets
 
 File 4: A function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set
 
 File 5: A function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary
 
 File 6: A function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys
 
 File 7: A function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary
 
 File 8: A function that deletes a key in a dictionary
         key argument will always be a string / If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change
         
 File 9: A function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
         assumes that all values are only integers / Returns a new dictionary
         
 File 10: A function that returns a key with the biggest integer value
          assumes that all values are only integers / assumes all students have a different score / Returns none if no score found
          
 File 11: A function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops
          Initial list should not be modified / Same length as my_list / Each value should be multiplied by number
          
 File 12:  a function hat converts a Roman numeral to an integer
           assumes the number will be between 1 to 3999 / Returns 0 if roman numeral is not a string or None
           
 File 100: A function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)  
  
 File 101: A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
           maximum 3 lines / Initial matrix should not be modified / Matrix is a 2D array /  not allowed to use for or while
  
 File 102: A function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary
           If the value doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change / All keys having the searched value have to be deleted
